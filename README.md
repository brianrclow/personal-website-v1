# personal-website-v1

personal-website-v1 is my first take on a personal website where I keep up to date information about myself, my projects and links to other areas of interest. This version is no longer live, check out my new version here: [portfolio]([https://github.com/brianrclow/personal-website-v2/](https://github.com/brianrclow/portfolio))

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about the process of web development and how to host a website. I also wanted a place where I could link to my other social accounts and be a hub for me as a person and as a developer.
